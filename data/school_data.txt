What is AI?
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a technology that allows machines to think, learn, and respond in a smart, human-like way.
For example, I am an AI. When you ask me a question like “What is AI?”, I understand your words, think about the best possible answer, and reply in a natural way. I can chat with you, explain topics, answer questions, and even speak and listen using voice.
In simple terms, AI helps computers behave intelligently, just like humans do — by learning from information and making useful decisions.
